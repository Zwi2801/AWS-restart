                 Project 1: Building a Static Website for a Restaurant and Presenting AWS Migration Benefits

**Project Overview**

In this project, I worked in a group of 5 people and we were tasked with designing and hosting a static website for a real-world restaurant using AWS. The restaurant is facing operational challenges due to a growing number of customer bookings and orders, which are currently managed using manual processes such as paper records or basic spreadsheets. As a result, bookings are often double-booked, orders get mixed up, and customer requests are difficult to track.

La Lumiere is the restaurant we selected to work with. La Lumiere offers a fine dining experience with a multicourse tasting menu, seasonal ingredients and an award winning wine selection. The goal is to create a unique and a memorable experience for every guest through creativity, quality and elegance. However, the restaurant is currently facing many challenges, including managing large amounts of customers and reservation data difficulties, especially when storing and managing information like menus, images and booking records. Additionally,   there’s no online booking options which leads to mix-up of customers’ orders  

                                            Key Project Objectives

The main purpose of this project was to create a simple, user-friendly website for La Lumiere restaurant that allows customers to place orders and make reservations online, helping the restaurant streamline its operations. Another key objective was to host the website on AWS using cloud services, specifically Amazon S3 which then highlighted the benefits of cloud migration, including scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Using other AWS services to get a more in-depth understanding was also encouraged.

In addition to building the website, I was required to prepare a presentation explaining how migrating the restaurant’s digital presence to AWS would improve efficiency, scalability, and reliability. The presentation was designed for a business-focused audience, such as the restaurant owner or a mock decision-making panel.

                                        Website Outline and Functionality

The La Lumiere website was designed to be easily accessible, easy to navigate and definitely user friendly. The home page introduces the restaurant and gives visitors a welcoming first impression and provides an overview of the restaurant’s type of cuisine offered and how to make a reservation or an order.

To address he difficulties with managing the large number of bookings and reservations, the website includes a booking form where customers can request table reservations and an order submission form for food orders. After submitting a form, customers are directed to a confirmation page, which reassures them that their request has been received. The website uses minimal colours to ensure readability while still incorporating images to enhance the overall design and user experience.

Some of the pictures of the "Best sellers" shown on the website hosted on S3 as as ffollows:

                                         AWS Services Used in the Project

Amazon S3 was chosen as the primary host for the static website because it is highly reliable, secure, and cost-effective, especially for static websites. There were other AWS services such as AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB to enhance the website and its functionality to be enhanced.

While the project focuses on static hosting, the architecture can later be expanded to include databases, serverless backends, or analytics services as the business grows.

                                           Key Benefits of AWS for La Lumiere

We conducted a cost analysis and i reveled that using S3 is very affordable because it follows a “pay as you go” model meaning the restaurant only pays for the storage and data it actually uses. It also offers scalable solution in that it allows the website to automatically handle more visitors without downtime, its high performance ensures fast loading speed using AWS global reach and it provides strong security through encryption and automatic backups keeping all data safe.

                                              Presentation Summary
As part of this project, we created a PowerPoint presentation to explain the solution and its benefits, and we got a chance to actually present to one of our facilitations where we provided clarity where necessary. The presentation included an overview of the restaurant, the challenges it faced, the proposed AWS solution, and the advantages of cloud migration. Getting the opportunity to present our ideas definitely enhanced our presentation skills.

                                                Key takeways and conclusin

1. **Cloud-based websites simplify operations**- Amazon S3 is ideal for static website hosting which allows customers to submit bookings and orders digitally, reducing human error and administrative workload. S3 also provides a cost-effective, scalable, and highly available solution for hosting static websites and media assets.
2. **Improved customer experience leads to better business outcomes**- Online forms and confirmations give customers clarity and confidence, while reducing confusion for staff.
3. **AWS enables scalability without upfront investment**- The restaurant can handle increased customer demand without purchasing or maintaining on-premises hardware.The centralised digital access will improve data visibility even with a simple static setup, moving online creates a foundation for tracking customer interactions and preferences.
4. **Professional online presence builds trust**-A well-designed website enhances the restaurant’s brand image and credibility.

The solution definitely provided a strong foundation for future growth and digital transformation for La Lumiere restaurant.
