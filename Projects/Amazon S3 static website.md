                 Project 1: Building a Static Website for a Restaurant and Presenting AWS Migration Benefits

**Project Overview**

In this project, I worked in a group of 5 people and we were tasked with designing and hosting a static website for a real-world restaurant using AWS. The restaurant is facing operational challenges due to a growing number of customer bookings and orders, which are currently managed using manual processes such as paper records or basic spreadsheets. As a result, bookings are often double-booked, orders get mixed up, and customer requests are difficult to track.

La Lumiere is the restaurant we selected to work with. La Lumiere offers a fine dining experience with a multicourse tasting menu, seasonal ingredients and an award winning wine selection. The goal is to create a unique and a memorable experience for every guest through creativity, quality and elegance. However, the restaurant is currently facing many challenges, including managing large amounts of customers and reservation data difficulties, especially when storing and managing information like menus, images and booking records. Additionally,   there’s no online booking options which leads to mix-up of customers’ orders
