**Project Overview**

This was also a group project where a group of 5 members were tasked with explaining the AWS architecture designed to support a next-generation 3D e-commerce web application. The platform must be globally available, highly scalable, secure, fast, and cost-efficient while rendering 3D models to millions of users. Below is a breakdown of the AWS services selected, why they were chosen, and how the final solution meets all business and technical requirements.

Our team took on the role of Cloud Practitioners and designed an AWS architecture that meets both business needs and technical requirements. This included selecting appropriate AWS services for storage, compute, networking, security, scalability, and monitoring, and ensuring the system can handle unpredictable traffic spikes without sacrificing performance or reliability.

                                        Key Project Objectives

1. Design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture that ensures that the platform is available 24/7
2. To learn more about AWS services that can scale automatically to handle sudden increases in global user traffic
3. Ensure that the platform will have high performance, particularly for delivering and rendering 3D content with low latency
4. Apply AWS security best practices to protect customer data and application resources
5. To put measure in place to ensure that the architecture optimizes costs by using managed services, auto scaling, and monitoring tools
6. Clearly explain architectural decisions and how each AWS service supports the system’s requirements
