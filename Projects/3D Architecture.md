**Project Overview**

This was also a group project where a group of 5 members were tasked with explaining the AWS architecture designed to support a next-generation 3D e-commerce web application. The platform must be globally available, highly scalable, secure, fast, and cost-efficient while rendering 3D models to millions of users. Below is a breakdown of the AWS services selected, why they were chosen, and how the final solution meets all business and technical requirements.
