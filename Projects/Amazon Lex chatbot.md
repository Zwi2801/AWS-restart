         Project 3: Amazon Lex Chatbot

This is project I completed with four other candidates in the program focused on creating an interactive chatbot using Amazon Lex, an AWS service designed for building conversational applications. The goal was to understand how chatbots work and how they can be used as effective learning tools. The project was completed in two parts: first, building a simple chatbot to understand the basics of Amazon Lex, and second, expanding the chatbot into an interactive quiz designed for learners.

The chatbot was created for a fictional educational company, **CloudLearners Inc.**, which wanted an engaging way to test learners’ knowledge of Amazon S3. We named the chatbot ******** which we presented to CloudLearners Inc. Through this project, I gained pratical experience in chatbot design, user interaction flow, and presenting a technical solution to a non-technical audience.

                                        Key Project Objectives

The main objective of this project was to design and deploy a functional chatbot using Amazon Lex. The chatbot needed to understand user input, respond appropriately, and guide users through an interactive experience.

**Additional objectives included:**

1. Learning how to configure and manage a chatbot in Amazon Lex
2. Creating intent-driven conversations using utterances and responses
3. Designing a simple knowledge quiz with customized logic
