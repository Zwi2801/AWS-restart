                          LAB 263-Create Subnets and VPC 
In this lab, I deep dived in an environment where I learnt to create a virtual network using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets. The main purpose of this exercise was to fundamentally provide secure, scalable, and well-organized network architectures and manage connectivity between different parts of a network. This lab provided a practical experience on defining subnets, and understanding routing and network isolation in the cloud especially. 

**Lab Objectives**
1. Get a good understanding of what a VPC is and the purpose of creating a VPC
2. Configured routing tables to allow or restrict traffic between subnets.
3. Creating multiple subnets in the VPC for varying network segments.
4. Set up internet gateways to provide external connectivity where needed.
5. Verified and validated the VPC and subnet configurations by checking IP ranges and routes.
6. Get an understanding on how network segmentation helps improve security and manageability
