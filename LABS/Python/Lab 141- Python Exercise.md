                  LAB 141 - Python Exercise

This lab enabled me to expand my knowledge and get practical experience on how Python is a powerful, flexible, and beginner-friendly programming language that plays a major role in modern software development and cloud computing. It is known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility, which makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python is commonly used in areas such as web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Learning Python helped me understand how programming logic works and how code can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently.

In this lab, after successfully connecting to the instance, I wrote and tested a Python script that identified all prime numbers between 1 and 250 and saved the results to a text file. This lab helped bridge infrastructure skills (SSH and EC2 access) with basic scripting and automation in a cloud environment.

                  Key Objectives

1. Securely connect an EC2 instance named Linux Host.
2. Connect to the instance via SSH.
3. Write and execute a Python 3 script on a remote server
4. Save program output to a file and verify the results
5. Gain hands-on experience working in a cloud-hosted Linux environment

                      Process followed- Task Breakdown

   **Task 1: Accessing SSH Credentials**

I kicked off the lab by opening the Lab Details panel and displayed the credentials then I downloaded the SSH private key and noted the public IP address of the Linux host. I connected to the instance using the SSH command. Once connected, access to the Linux host was confirmed without the need for a password, using key-based authentication.

**Task 2: Writing the Python Script**

Created a Python script and I implemented logic to loop through numbers from 1 to 250, identify prime numbers and store the results in a file called results.txt. I then saved the script and recorded its absolute file path for future reference.

**Task 3: Run the Python Script**

In your terminal, run python3 prime_numbers.py then all the prime numbers were displayed.

**Task 4: Testing and Verification**

Verified that the results.txt file was created and was running then I also confirmed that the file contained the correct list of prime numbers. 




This lab reinforced both cloud infrastructure fundamentals and basic scripting skills, making it a valuable hands-on exercise for understanding how applications and servers are managed in real-world AWS environments.
