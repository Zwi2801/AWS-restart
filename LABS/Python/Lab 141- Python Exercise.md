                  LAB 141 - Python Exercise

This lab enabled me to expand my knowledge and get practical experience on how Python is a powerful, flexible, and beginner-friendly programming language that plays a major role in modern software development and cloud computing. It is known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility, which makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python is commonly used in areas such as web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Learning Python helped me understand how programming logic works and how code can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently.

In this lab, after successfully connecting to the instance, I wrote and tested a Python script that identified all prime numbers between 1 and 250 and saved the results to a text file. This lab helped bridge infrastructure skills (SSH and EC2 access) with basic scripting and automation in a cloud environment.
