              Introduction to Python in AWS

Python is a powerful, flexible, and beginner-friendly programming language that plays a major role in modern software development and cloud computing. It is known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility, which makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python is commonly used in areas such as web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Learning Python helped me understand how programming logic works and how code can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently.



              AWS Cloud 9 and Python

AWS Cloud9 is the service I used to work with Python, which is a cloud-based development environment provided by AWS. I navigated to the Cloud 9 platform on the AWS console and I was able to run Python directly in the cloud without installing anything on my local system.

Using Cloud9 was quite seamless and exciting as it was easy to write code with Python, and execute programs in real time. The environment provided a code editor, terminal, and file management tools all in one place. Working in Cloud9 showed how Python can be used in a cloud environment, which is useful for automation and cloud-based tasks.

                  Key Takeaways, Challenges encountered and Resolutions

There were various challenges that I faced as I was completing the various Python labs. One of my main challeneges was writing correct logic for loops and conditional statements, which required practice. At times, remembering the correct structure of functions and how to use them properly was also difficult. Additionally, getting familiar with Cloud9 tools and the terminal took some time as I have limited experience with working in a cloud-based environment. I broke problems into smaller steps to make complex logic easier to handle, and re-running code multiple times to test solutions and improve accuracy are some of the steps I carried out to resolve the challenges I encountered.

Lastly, understanding Python syntax and indentation was challenging, as even small mistakes could cause errors. Debugging the errors, especially when the code did not run as expected at first was quite difficult to resolve. Practicing coding regularly to get familiar with Python syntax and indentation was how I resolved this challenge and I have improved greatly.
