              Introduction to Python in AWS

Python is a powerful, flexible, and beginner-friendly programming language that plays a major role in modern software development and cloud computing. It is known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility, which makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python is commonly used in areas such as web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Learning Python helped me understand how programming logic works and how code can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently.



              AWS Cloud 9 and Python

AWS Cloud9 is the service I used to work with Python, which is a cloud-based development environment provided by AWS. I navigated to the Cloud 9 platform on the AWS console and I was able to run Python directly in the cloud without installing anything on my local system.

Using Cloud9 was quite seamless and exciting as it was easy to write code with Python, and execute programs in real time. The environment provided a code editor, terminal, and file management tools all in one place. Working in Cloud9 showed how Python can be used in a cloud environment, which is useful for automation and cloud-based tasks.
