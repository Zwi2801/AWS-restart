📂 Project 1.1 SECURITY
                            LAB 276 NETWORK HARDENING
In this lab, I deep dived in an environment with Lambda functions with vulnerabilities were subsequently scanned by Amazon inspector and reported in a findings report as per severity. The aim of this exercise was to understand how Activate Amazon Inspector, and proactively analyse and interpret vulnerability findings to ensure a safe and secure environment. The exercise taught me how to monitor potential threaths in the environment, and identify potential security threats, and help me understand the importance of upholding system integrity.
