                      LAB 175-Using Autoscaling in AWS

**Overview**

In this lab, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is utilised to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI),which in simple terms is a template that will be used to launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance to host a web server. The AMI is then used as the bae for launching a system that scales automatically under a variable load by using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. I also created an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute the load across EC2 instances created in multiple Availability Zones through ensuring the required auto scaling configuration.
