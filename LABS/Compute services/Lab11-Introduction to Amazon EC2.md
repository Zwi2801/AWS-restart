                  LAB 11- Introduction to Amazon EC2

**Overview**

This lab provided in-depth and practicel experience with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a core AWS service used to create and manage virtual servers in the cloud. Amazon EC2 allows users to quickly launch computing resources without friction, adjust capacity as needed, monitor performance, and only pay for what they use.

Throughout the lab, I launched an EC2 instance configured as a simple web server, monitored its health and performance, adjusted security settings to allow web traffic to flow freely., I then resized the instance and storage to demonstrate scalability, tested termination protection, and finally terminated the instance. This lab demonstrated how EC2 supports flexibility, scalability, and secure cloud-based computing.

                  Key Objectives

1. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance enabled with termination protection 
2. Deploy a basic web server using a user data script
3. Monitor the EC2 instance using status checks and CloudWatch metrics
4. Modify a security group to allow HTTP access
5. Resize the EC2 instance and its EBS storage volume
6. Test and understand termination protection
7. Safely terminate an EC2 instance
