                     LAB 275 Introduction to Amazon DB

**Overview**
In this lab, I got hands-on and practical experience with Amazon DynamoDB through the creation of a table to store information about a music library then I also queried the music library and then deleted the DynamoDB table. Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service with a fully managed database that supports both document and key-value data models. It is ideal  Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale, specifically mobile, web, gaming, ad-tech, Internet of Things (IoT), and many other applications.
