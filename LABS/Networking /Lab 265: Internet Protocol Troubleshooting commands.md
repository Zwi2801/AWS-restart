                      LAB 265 - Internet Protocol Troubleshooting commands
**Overview**

In this lab, I explored how to practice troubleshooting commands and to test connectivity to and from a launched EC2 instance through running the ping command. I learnt that the ping command is used this to test connectivity and ensure that it allows Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) requests on the security level, such as security groups and network ACLs. This was done through a simulated practice similar to a real life scenario where one would have to assist a customer in helping the customer address their issues which gave it a different element and offered a great and practical learning moment.
                      
                      Key Objectives
1. Practice troubleshooting commands
2. Get an understanding of the layers and how troubleshooting commands flow with the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
3. In depth understanding of the Ping, Traceroute, Netstat, Telnet and Curl command
4. Identify how these commands can be used in customer scenarios

                   Process followed- Tasks breakdown

**Task 1: Use SSH to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance**
This lab was also centered around a scenario provided by a customer and I had the network administrator role who was responsible for troubleshooting customer issues which will be mentioned in greater detail in the next task. The first task involved connecting to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance using an SSH utility to perform the required operations.
