                      LAB 265 - Internet Protocol Troubleshooting commands
**Overview**

In this lab, I explored how to practice troubleshooting commands and to test connectivity to and from a launched EC2 instance through running the ping command. I learnt that the ping command is used this to test connectivity and ensure that it allows Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) requests on the security level, such as security groups and network ACLs. This was done through a simulated practice similar to a real life scenario where one would have to assist a customer in helping the customer address their issues which gave it a different element and offered a great and practical learning moment.
